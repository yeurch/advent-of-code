# Advent of Code 2022

This directory hosts my solutions to the 2022 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
using Go.

I've never written anything beyond a Hello World in Go before, and have spent a few hours
going through the [Interactive Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1).
I feel that this year is going to be quite a challenge, and similar to last year, I'm unlikely
to produce any great examples of idiomatic Go.

### How to

For each day:

* Do stuff (TBD)

### System Requirements

I'm using Go version 1.19.1 on Pop!_OS 22.04. Any later version of Go should work just fine, and I don't see myself using any Linux-specific code, so it should "just work" on Windows and Mac too. You can get
Rust from [the official Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).
