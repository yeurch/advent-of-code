# Advent of Code 2020

This directory hosts my solutions to the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
using Python.

These aren't the most elegant solutions, and I'm not trying to get on the
leaderboards (the puzzles are published each day at 5am in my timezone, when
I'm very much definitely sleeping).  In fact, they're probably not very good
Python at all, as it's not a language I'd consider myself to be an expert in.

### System Requirements

Running the solutions requires Python *3.9* or later.  This is required for
(at the very least) the use of the high-precision timer `time.time_ns()`.
