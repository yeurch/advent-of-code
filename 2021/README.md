# Advent of Code 2021

This directory hosts my solutions to the 2021 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
using Rust.

I've never written anything beyond a Hello World in Rust before, and have spent a few hours
reading [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (but not practiced anything in it).
I feel that this year is going to be quite a challenge, and similar to last year, I'm unlikely
to produce any great examples of idiomatic Rust.

### System Requirements

I'm using the latest edition of Rust, 1.56.1, installed via `rustup` on Windows 10. You can get
Rust from [the official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
