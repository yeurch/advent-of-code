# Advent of Code

This repository hosts my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com),
using various programming languages.

If you're participating in AoC this year, please don't look at my solutions
until you've solved the puzzle for yourself. Where's the fun in that?! But
do come back and take a look when you've solved them, and feel free to
[start up a discussion](https://github.com/yeurch/advent-of-code/discussions).
